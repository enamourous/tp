## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

* [**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `archive 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("archive 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchiveCommandSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `archive 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `archiveCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `archiveCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `archiveCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to archive a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `archiveCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Handling Payments in the Model

- `Person` objects are immutable. Any addition, deletion, or edit of a payment produces a new `Person` object.
- `Model#setPerson()` replaces the old object in both the master and filtered lists.
- Undo/redo works seamlessly because each state stores the entire `AddressBook`, including `Person` payment lists.
- Logging occurs for every mutating action via `LogsCenter`, aiding debugging and traceability.


### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `archive 5` command to archive the 5th person in the address book. The `archive` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `archive 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `archive`, just save the person being archived).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### Non-Functional Requirements

### 1. Data Requirements
* **Data Volatility** â€” Person and payment data should be stored persistently and remain intact between sessions.  
  Data changes (add, edit, archive, payment updates) are only committed upon successful command execution.
* **Data Consistency** â€” The system must prevent conflicting updates (e.g., deleting a payment after it was archived).  
  Undo/redo operations must preserve logical consistency across all entities.
* **Data Integrity** â€” Each person must have a unique combination of `Name` and `Matriculation Number`.  
  Archived records must retain their associated payments for traceability.
* **Data Security** â€” User data is stored locally in JSON format. The application does not transmit any data externally.
* **Data Recoverability** â€” In the event of an abnormal termination, the most recent successful state should be recoverable upon restart.

---

### 2. Technical Requirements
* **Platform Compatibility** â€” The application must run on any mainstream OS (Windows, macOS, Linux, Unix) with **Java 17** or above installed.
* **Build System** â€” The project uses **Gradle** for compilation, testing, and packaging (shadow JAR for distribution).
* **Architecture** â€” Follows the **AB3 MVC architecture** (`Logic`, `Model`, `Storage`, `UI`) for maintainability and modularity.
* **Logging** â€” The application should log command execution and errors through `LogsCenter` for debugging and traceability.
* **Error Handling** â€” Parsing and validation errors should never crash the application; they must show user-friendly error messages.
* **Extensibility** â€” New commands (e.g., `export`, `import`) should be addable without major refactoring due to consistent parserâ€“command structure.

---

### 3. Performance Requirements
* **Startup Time** â€” The application should launch and display the active list within **â‰¤ 2 seconds** on a typical laptop.
* **Command Latency** â€” Each command (`archive`, `unarchive`, `find`, `addpayment`, `deletepayment`, etc.) must execute within **â‰¤ 150 ms** for a dataset of  
  up to **5,000 persons** and **20 payments per person**.
* **Undo/Redo Depth** â€” The undo/redo system must support **at least 20 reversible steps** without performance degradation.
* **Responsiveness** â€” UI updates (switching between active/archived views) should occur instantly upon command completion.
* **Storage Efficiency** â€” The application should remain performant and responsive even with file sizes up to **10 MB**.

---

### 4. Scalability Requirements
* **Data Volume** â€” The system must handle at least **1,000 active persons** and **20,000 total payments** with no noticeable slowdown.
* **Feature Scalability** â€” The architecture should support future extensions such as `export`, `import`, or `statistics` without affecting core logic.
* **Storage Format** â€” The JSON-based storage can be evolved (e.g., adding new fields) while maintaining backward compatibility through the adapter pattern.
* **Multi-entity Extension** â€” The system can be extended to support new entity types (e.g., CCA Events, Expenses) using the existing command framework.

---

### 5. Usability Requirements
* **Command Efficiency** â€” A user with above-average typing speed should accomplish most tasks faster using text commands than the mouse.
* **Command Feedback** â€” All commands must provide clear success or error messages in the result display.
* **Error Recovery** â€” Invalid commands must not corrupt data and should guide the user toward correct syntax via `MESSAGE_USAGE`.
* **Consistency** â€” Command syntax and usage follow AB3 conventions (e.g., prefixes like `n/`, `e/`, `m/`, `p/`).
* **Learnability** â€” First-time users should be able to perform basic actions (add, find, archive, view) within **10 minutes** of exploration.
* **Accessibility** â€” The UI should be readable and usable on screens as small as **1280Ã—720**, with high-contrast text for visibility.

---

### 6. Constraints
* **Offline Operation** â€” The application must operate fully offline without network connectivity.
* **Single User Environment** â€” Only one user instance interacts with the data file at any time (no concurrency control required).
* **No External Database** â€” All data must be stored locally; the use of external servers or cloud databases is not permitted.
* **File Corruption Handling** â€” If the data file becomes unreadable, the app should display a clear error message and fall back to an empty dataset.
* **Open Source Requirement** â€” The full source code must be publicly available on GitHub.
* **Coding Standards** â€” All code must conform to the projectâ€™s Java coding standard and pass Checkstyle verification.

---

### Glossary

* **Mainstream OS** â€” Commonly used operating systems such as **Windows**, **Linux**, **Unix**, and **macOS**.
* **Student ID** â€” A unique identification code assigned to each **NUS student** (e.g., A0123456X).
* **CCA** â€” Stands for *Co-Curricular Activity*; refers to a **student club, society, or organization** in NUS.
* **Archived Person** â€” A person who has been soft-deleted from the active list but remains in storage for record-keeping.
* **Payment Record** â€” A transaction entry associated with a person, containing an **amount**, **date**, and optional **remarks**.
* **Predicate** â€” A filtering condition used in the appâ€™s logic layer to determine which persons are displayed in the UI.
* **Command Word** â€” The keyword used to trigger a command (e.g., `archive`, `find`, `undo`).
* **Model** â€” The component responsible for holding data and business logic; updates the UI through observable lists.
* **View** â€” The user interface layer that reflects the current state of the model (e.g., active list, archived list, payment view).
* **Undo/Redo Stack** â€” A pair of internal data structures that track the history of changes for reversible commands.

### **Appendix: Instructions for manual testing**

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

**Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

</box>

### **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**
Our team size is 5.
* Payment dashboard (A quick visualisation of all payments)
* Store and access member and payment data from multiple CCAs (Separate storage)
* Some of our error messages may not identify the exact cause of error, and may return a general error message which provides the correct command format to use. We will be refining these error messages to target their specific cause in the future versions.
* Our `editpayment` and `archivepayment` features may function without using viewpayment to view the payment indices. This will be fixed in a future version.

### Appendix: Effort

### Overview
The project builds on the AddressBook Level 3 (AB3) foundation but significantly expands its scope and complexity.  
While AB3 manages a single entity type (`Person`), our project introduces **multiple entity states and relationships**:
* **Archived vs Active persons** with distinct filters, views, and persistence logic.
* **Payment records** linked to each person, with support for amount, date, and remarks fields.
* **Undo/Redo** functionality for all mutating commands, increasing both user convenience and implementation complexity.

These extensions required architectural changes across the `Model`, `Logic`, `Storage`, and `UI` layers, while maintaining compatibility with the existing AB3 command architecture.

---

### Challenges Faced
1. **Multi-file updates and merge conflicts**  
   Introducing new attributes (e.g., `archived` flag, payment list) required synchronized updates across the `Person`, `JsonAdaptedPerson`, `Storage`, and `Ui` classes.  
   Coordinating these updates required coordination and communication to minimise merge conflicts and overwrites.

2. **Payment interface design**  
   Designing a flexible payment model that stores multiple payments per person with amount, date, and optional remarks demanded careful consideration of immutability and display ordering.  
   Commands like `addpayment`, `deletepayment`, `editpayment`, and `viewpayment` required custom parsing and validation logic distinct from AB3â€™s single-field operations.

3. **Archived/Active view management**  
   Implementing `archive`, `unarchive`, and `listarchived` introduced the need for dynamic predicate switching (`PREDICATE_SHOW_ACTIVE_PERSONS` vs `PREDICATE_SHOW_ARCHIVED_PERSONS`).  
   Ensuring that archived persons were excluded from normal search and list results, while still being able to manage their payments required defensive programming and extensive testing across commands.

4. **Undo/Redo functionality**  
   Maintaining consistent application state after consecutive undo/redo operations required snapshot-based history tracking in the `Model`.  
   Edge cases involving sequential operations (e.g., `archive â†’ undo â†’ addpayment â†’ undo â†’ redo`) were challenging to reason about and verify.

5. **UI synchronization**  
   Modifying the UI to display the Archived label and each member's latest payment.

---

### Effort and Achievements
* **Code effort:** approximately **1.5Ã— the effort of base AB3**, due to additional entity relationships, new commands, validation, and UI enhancements.
* **Testing effort:** expanded significantly, as new commands (`archive`, `unarchive`, `undo`, `redo`, and payment operations) required both unit and integration tests to maintain >80% coverage.
* **Collaboration effort:** frequent merges and PR reviews to maintain consistent architecture and coding standards.

**Key achievements:**
* Successfully implemented **two distinct views** for archived and active persons.
* Created a robust **payment interface** that tracks transaction amount, date, and remarks.
* Added **undo/redo** functionality, improving user experience and reliability.
* Enhanced test coverage and logging, ensuring stability under edge cases.

---

### Reuse and Efficiency
A small portion of the project (~10%) reused or adapted existing AB3 utilities and parser logic:
* The `ArgumentTokenizer`, `ParserUtil`, and `CommandResult` classes were reused with minor extensions.
* This reuse allowed us to focus effort on implementing new domain logic (e.g., payment handling, undo/redo, archived filtering) rather than reimplementing core infrastructure.
* The saved effort was redirected toward improving **test depth**, **code readability**, and **UI integration**.

---

### Summary
In summary, our project demonstrates a substantial step beyond AB3 in both **functionality** and **complexity**.  
By integrating **multiple data dimensions**, **state management**, and **user-friendly undo/redo capabilities**, we produced a feature-rich, reliable, and user-oriented application that serves the needs of our target audience.
